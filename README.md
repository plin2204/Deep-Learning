# Deep-Learning
Analyze and classify the success of charitable donations by implementing a **Deep Learning Nural Ntworks** using the **TensorFlow** platform in **Python**.


## Steps
1. Implement **neural network** models using **TensorFlow**.
2. **Preprocess** and construct datasets for neural network models.
3. Implement **deep neural network** models using **TensorFlow**.
4. Save **trained TensorFlow** models for later use.
